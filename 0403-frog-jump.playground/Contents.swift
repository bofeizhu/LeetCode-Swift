/// 403. Frog Jump
/// A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may
/// not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
/// Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is
/// able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone
/// and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.
/// If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units.
/// Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
///
/// - Note:
///     The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
///     Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
///     The first stone's position is always 0.
